<h1>High availability vs. Fault tolerance vs. Disaster recovery</h1>

1) HA

A highly available system is one designed to be online and providing services as often as possible. It's a system designed so when it fails its components can be fixed or replaced as quickly as possible often using automation.

HA is not about user experience, if a system fails and the component is replaced and that disrupts service for few seconds that's ok. It's still highly available. HA is about maximizing system's online time.

2) FT

Fault tolerance allows system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of some of its components.

3) DR

A set of policies, tools and procedures to enable the recovery or continuation of vital technology infrastructure and systems following a natural or human-induced distaster.
